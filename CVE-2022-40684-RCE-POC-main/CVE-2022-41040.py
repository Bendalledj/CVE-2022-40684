CVE-2022-40684 Remote Code Execution Proof of Concept

README.md - The readme will repeat all the following information so you don't forget it:

automate.py - Automates the check_targets.py and CVE-2022-40684.py so you can check targets for vulnerabilities then exploit those vulnerabilities without having to do it all by hand individually

check_targets.py - As the name says, it checks targets. You pull a list of targets from Shodan or Zoom eye, throw the IPs into a text file, and then scan them to check if they're vulnerable or not.

CVE-2022-40684.py - The holy grail. The PoC is in fully working condition, you can see more of how it works back on our github page.

config.xml - We created this exploit template for you but by all means though you could write your own or tweak ours.

Have fun!
